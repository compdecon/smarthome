Neil Cherry created a Home Automation demo board that he uses for his Smart Home presentations. This project aims to do the same for the [CDL](https://compdecon.github.io/). The demo board will reside in the lab and be an interactive demo. It can further be used for classes on programming, electronics, web development and automation as well as control and monitoring of a Smart Home.
